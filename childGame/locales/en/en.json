Each player must answer three questions.\nEach round represents a season (fall, winter, spring, summer) for sand farming.\n\nRounds 1-3: General information questions\n\nPlayers take turns answering the questions they are offered.\nQuestions cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels.\nThe total score for each correct answer is calculated at the end of each round.\n\nThe round ends when all players have answered 9 questions or when one player has completed all questions correctly.\nTo advance on the board, each player will be asked to answer 9 questions in each round. If the answer is correct, they continue to the next question.\nAfter the score is calculated, the winners of each round (1st place + 2nd place) will roll the dice to determine how far they move on the board.\nIn each round, there are different challenges, such as acting games, puzzles, or mind games.",
